# Youtube Thumbnail Generator

A lightweight, single‑page canvas app to compose YouTube‑style thumbnails. Load or generate background/overlay images, position a pose cutout, add two big headline lines, tweak transforms (x/y/scale/rotation/mirror), and export a ready‑to‑use image.

The frontend is pure HTML5 Canvas (`index.html`). A tiny PHP helper (`image.php`) handles two things:
- Generating images from prompts via Google Gemini (by sending `gemini://<prompt>` URLs)
- Proxying HTTPS image URLs (e.g., Unsplash) to avoid CORS and attach an API key when available

## Features
- Background, SecondImage, ThirdImage inputs (URL or local file)
- Pose picker with 28 built‑in thumbnails (`img/poses` and `img/poses_thumbs`)
- Pose chroma‑key masking with color sampling, tolerance and softness controls
- Two text lines with stylized rendering and transform controls per element
- Per‑element transforms: x, y, scale, rotation, mirror horizontal/vertical
- Prompt‑based generation buttons (P → Generate) for Background/Second/Third/Pose
- Deep link of current state via URL query string
- One‑click "Download" to export the canvas as a JPEG

## Requirements
- PHP 8+ with cURL extension enabled
- Internet access for:
  - Gemini image generation (required when using prompts)
  - Unsplash (optional, if you paste Unsplash links)
- A simple local PHP server (e.g., `php -S`)

## Quick start
```bash
# From the project root
sudo php -S 127.0.0.1:80
# Then open in your browser:
# http://127.0.0.1:80/index.html
```

If you plan to use prompt‑based generation, create a `.env` file first (see below).

## Environment variables (.env)
Create a file named `.env` in the project root. The file is git‑ignored.

```dotenv
# Required for prompt-based generation via Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Optional: appended when proxying Unsplash links
UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID=your_unsplash_client_id
```

`image.php` loads `.env` keys and will return errors if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing when using `gemini://` prompts.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (via the local PHP server).
2. Choose sources:
   - Background/SecondImage/ThirdImage: paste an HTTPS URL or pick a local file.
   - Click the small "P" button to reveal a prompt field, then press "Generate" to create an image via Gemini.
   - Pose: pick an index (0–27). Optionally enter a prompt to generate a new pose based on the current pose image.
3. Adjust transforms for each element (x/y/scale/rotation/mirror) using the sliders next to each input.
4. Pose masking:
   - Toggle Mask to enable chroma‑key removal.
   - Use Sample to pick a key color from the pose image border.
   - Tweak Tolerance and Softness for cleaner edges.
5. Text lines:
   - Fill `Text1` and `Text2`, then use their transform sliders to place/scale/rotate.
6. DeepLink updates as you work; copy it to share a reproducible state.
7. Click Download to save the composed canvas as a JPEG.

## Controls

### Keyboard
- **Selection**
  - **1**: Background
  - **2**: Pose
  - **3**: Text1
  - **4**: Text2
  - **5**: SecondImage
  - **6**: ThirdImage
  - **0 / 7 / 8 / 9**: Clear selection
- **Move**
  - **Arrow keys** or **W/A/S/D**: Move selected element
  - **Hold Shift**: Fine step movement (1px instead of 10px)
- **Rotate**
  - **Q / E**: Rotate selected element
  - **Hold Shift**: Fine rotation (1° instead of 5°)
- **Scale**
  - **+ / -**: Increase / decrease scale of selected element
  - **R / F**: Alternative scale shortcuts (R = bigger, F = smaller)
  - **Hold Shift**: Fine scale steps

### Mouse and touch
- **Left‑click** canvas to select; click again on the same spot to cycle layers under the cursor.
- **Drag (Left mouse)**: Move selected element.
- **Drag (Middle mouse)**: Scale selected element.
- **Drag (Right mouse)**: Rotate selected element.
- **Mouse wheel over canvas**: Scale selected element (Shift = reduce sensitivity).
- **Touch (one finger)**: Drag to move selected element.

### Lists and assets
- **AI Poses** and **AI Backgrounds** are paginated by default; use the “Show all” button to reveal all items.
- **Delete generated item**: Click the “×” on a thumbnail. Hold **Shift** while clicking to delete without confirmation.

## How it works
- Frontend (`index.html`):
  - Renders everything via HTML5 Canvas in 1280×720 by default.
  - Keeps UI state in the query string; the "DeepLink" anchor reflects the current state.
  - Uses a custom `gemini://<prompt>` URL scheme for on‑demand generation.
- Backend (`image.php`):
  - If the incoming URL starts with `gemini://`, it calls Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (`generateContent`) with the prompt. When generating a pose, the current pose image is attached as inline data for editing guidance, and a 16:9 aspect ratio is requested.
  - Saves generated images to `img/gemini/gemini-<sha1>.png` (disk cache) and serves them with long‑term cache headers.
  - If the incoming URL is HTTPS (e.g., Unsplash), it proxies and forwards only image content types, optionally adding `client_id` when `UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID` is set.

## Caching
Generated images are cached on disk under `img/gemini/` using a SHA‑1 hash of the prompt and optional pose reference. The folder is ignored by git (see `.gitignore`). Subsequent requests serve cached files directly.

## Troubleshooting
- "Missing GEMINI_API_KEY": add it to `.env` before using prompt generation.
- Nothing renders from an HTTPS URL:
  - Ensure the URL points to an image and is publicly accessible.
  - `image.php` only proxies image content types (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/SVG/ICO).
- Timeouts or partial downloads when proxying: the proxy limits very large files and has conservative timeouts; try a smaller image.
- 404 from proxy: the target didn’t return an image `Content-Type`.
- PHP errors: run the built‑in server in the project root so relative paths resolve.

## Folder structure (high level)
```
/               # project root
├─ index.html   # canvas UI and rendering logic
├─ image.php    # Gemini generation + HTTPS image proxy
├─ img/
│  ├─ poses/           # pose source images
│  ├─ poses_thumbs/    # pose thumbnails
│  └─ gemini/          # generated images cache (git-ignored)
└─ .env         # your secrets (git-ignored)
```

## Security and privacy
- Never commit `.env` to source control (already git‑ignored).
- Requests to third‑party services (Gemini, Unsplash) include your API keys when configured.
- The proxy only forwards image responses and strips non‑image content.

## Pose image preparation (9:16 utility)
Use `misc/pose_9_16.sh` to batch‑prepare pose assets for consistent compositing:
- Trims transparent edges.
- Pads to exact 9:16 with bottom alignment (no padding below the subject).
- Unifies all results to the same 9:16 size (largest width among inputs).
- Optionally optimizes PNGs with `pngquant` if installed.

Requirements:
- ImageMagick (`magick` or `convert`/`identify`), optional `pngquant`.

Typical usage:
- From the project root, targeting `img/poses`:
```bash
bash misc/pose_9_16.sh img/poses_9x16 img/poses/*.{png,PNG,webp,WEBP,jpg,JPG,jpeg,JPEG}
```
- Or from inside `img/poses`:
```bash
cd img/poses
bash ../../misc/pose_9_16.sh poses_9x16
```

Outputs:
- Raw 9:16 results: `<OUTDIR>` (default `_out_9x16`)
- Uniform + optimized: `<OUTDIR>_uniform`

Notes:
- Outputs are PNG with alpha preserved.
- After reviewing results in `<OUTDIR>_uniform`, you can copy them into `img/poses/`.
- Thumbnails in `img/poses_thumbs/` are not created by this script.
